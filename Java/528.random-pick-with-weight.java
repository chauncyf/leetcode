 * Testcase Example:  '["Solution", "pickIndex"]\n[[[1]], []]'
 *
 * Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of
 * index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in
 * proportion to its weight.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= w.length <= 10000
 * 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
 * pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ["Solution","pickIndex"]
 * [[[1]],[]]
 * Output: [null,0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
 * [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation of Input Syntax:
 * 
 * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments.
 * Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no
 * arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't
 * any.
